# AD API

## Requirements

Goals:

- AD API provides functionality to create the following applications:
  - Drive the vehicle on the route or drive to the requested positions in order.
  - Operate vehicle behavior such as starting and stopping.
  - Display or announce the vehicle status to operators, passengers, and people around.
  - Control vehicle devices such as doors.
  - Monitor the vehicle or drive it manually.
- AD API provides stable and long-term specifications. This enables unified access to all vehicles.
- AD API hides differences in version and implementation and absorbs the impact of changes.
- AD API has a default implementation and can be applied to some simple ODDs with options.
- The AD API implementation is extensible with the third-party components as long as it meets the specifications.

Non-goals:

- AD API does not cover security. Use it with other reliable methods.
