# Component interfaces

## Requirements

Goals:

- The component interface provides stable and medium-term specifications. This makes it easier to add components.
- The component interface clarifies the public and private parts of a component and improves maintainability.
- The component interface is extensible with the third-party design to improve the sub-components' reusability.

Non-goals:

- The component interface is just a specification, it does not include an implementation.

### Naming convention
