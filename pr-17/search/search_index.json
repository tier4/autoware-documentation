General pull request workflow # Autoware uses the fork-and-pull model. Refer to GitHub Docs for the detailed explanation of the model. The following is a general example of our pull request workflow. Create a fork. (for the first time only) Create an issue. Discuss the approach to the issue with maintainers. Write code in the agreed approach. Write the tests and documentation if necessary. Follow our guidelines when you write code, tests, and documentation. Coding guidelines Testing guidelines Documentation guidelines Follow our Commit guidelines when commit your change. Test the code. In the later review process, you will need to write what tests you have done. Create a pull request. Read the pull request template carefully and fill the required content. Assign reviewers after creating a pull request. If you have no rights to assign reviewers, just mention them instead. If you are not sure who to set reviewers, contact to the people written as the maintainer tag in package.xml . Wait for the pull request to be reviewed. The reviewers will review your code following our review guidelines . Take a look at the guidelines as well because it is good to understand the thoughts of the reviewer's side. If CI checks have failed, fix the errors. Address the review comments pointed out by the reviewers. If you cannot understand or agree with a review comment, discuss it with the reviewers and find a rational reason. The author should be responsible for the final content of their pull request. The reviewers are obligated to make the author understand the meanings of each comment. After you have done with them, re-request a review to the reviewers and back to 6. If there are no more new review comments, the reviewers will approve the pull request and go to 6. Merge the pull request. Confirm all items of the checklist are checked off before merging. Anyone with write access can merge the pull request if there is no special request from maintainers. Generally, the author is expected to merge it to feel responsible for their pull request. If the author does not have write access, ask the reviewers or maintainers. It is the author's responsibility to care about their own pull request until it is merged. CI checks # Autoware has several checks for a pull request. The results are shown at the bottom of the pull request page as below. If the \u274c mark is shown, click the Details button and investigate the failure reason. If the Required mark is shown, you cannot merge the pull request unless you resolve the error. If not, it is optional, but preferably it should be fixed. The following sections explain about common CI checks in Autoware. Note that some repositories may have different settings. DCO # The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. This workflow checks whether the pull request fulfills DCO . You need to confirm the required items and commit with git commit -s . Refer to the GitHub App page for more information. semantic-pull-request # Autoware uses Conventional Commits with the settings of commitizen/conventional-commit-types . This workflow checks whether the pull request follows Conventional Commits . Note that if there is only one commit in the pull request, you need to make the commit title semantic as well. This is due to GitHub's non-intuitive behavior when there is only one commit. GitHub uses the commit title for the squashed commit message, instead of the pull request title. Refer to amannn/action-semantic-pull-request for more detailed behaviors of this workflow. See our commit guidelines for the detailed rules. pre-commit # pre-commit is a tool to run formatters or linters when you commit. This workflow checks whether the pull request has no error with pre-commit . In the workflow pre-commit.ci - pr is enabled in the repository, it will automatically fix errors by pre-commit.ci as many as possible. If there are some errors remain, fix them manually. You can run pre-commit in your local environment by the following command: pre-commit run -a Or you can install pre-commit to the repository and automatically run it before committing: pre-commit install Since it is difficult to detect errors with no false positives, some jobs are split into another config file and marked as optional. To check them, use the --config option: pre-commit run -a --config .pre-commit-config-optional.yaml spell-check-differential # This workflow detects spelling mistakes using CSpell with our dictionary file . You can submit pull requests to tier4/autoware-spell-check-dict to update the dictionary. Since it is difficult to detect errors with no false positives, it is an optional workflow, but it is preferable to remove spelling mistakes as many as possible. build-and-test-differential # This workflow checks colcon build and colcon test for the pull request. To make the CI faster, it doesn't check all packages but only modified packages and the dependencies. build-and-test-differential-self-hosted # This workflow is the ARM64 version of build-and-test-differential . You need to add the ARM64 label to run this workflow. For reference information, since ARM machines are not supported by GitHub-hosted runners, we use self-hosted runners prepared by the AWF. Refer to GitHub Docs for the details about self-hosted runners. deploy-docs # This workflow deploys the preview documentation site for the pull request.

Autoware provides value for both The technology developers of autonomous driving systems can create new components based on Autoware. The service operators of autonomous driving systems, on the other hand, can select appropriate technology components with Autoware. This is enabled by the microautonomy architecture that modularizes its software stack into the core and universe subsystems (modules). Microautonomy architecture # Autoware uses a pipeline architecture to enable the development of autonomous driving systems. The pipeline architecture used in Autoware consists of components similar to three-layer-architecture . And they run in parallel. There are 2 main modules: the Core and the Universe. The components in these modules are designed to be extensible and reusable. And we call it microautonomy architecture. The Core module # The Core module contains basic runtimes and technology components that satisfy the basic functionality and capability of sensing, computing, and actuation required for autonomous driving systems. AWF develops and maintains the Core module with their architects and leading members through their working groups. Anyone can contribute to the Core but the PR(Pull Request) acceptance criteria is more strict compared to the Universe. The Universe module # The Universe modules are extensions to the Core module that can be provided by the technology developers to enhance the functionality and capability of sensing, computing, and actuation. AWF provides the base Universe module to extend from. A key feature of the microautonomy architecture is that the Universe modules can be contributed to by any organization and individual. That is, you can even create your Universe and make it available for the Autoware community and ecosystem. AWF is responsible for quality control of the Universe modules through their development process. As a result, there are multiple types of the Universe modules - some are verified and validated by AWF and others are not. It is up to the users of Autoware which Universe modules are selected and integrated to build their end applications. Interface design # The interface design is the most essential piece of the microautonomy architecture, which is classified into internal and external interfaces. The component interface is designed for the components in a Universe module to communicate with those in other modules, including the Core module, within Autoware internally. The AD(Autonomous Driving) API, on the other hand, is designed for the applications of Autoware to access the technology components in the Core and Universe modules of Autoware externally. Designing solid interfaces, the microautonomy architecture is made possible with our partners, and at the same time is made feasible for our partners. Challenges # A grand challenge of the microautonomy architecture is to achieve real-time capability, which guarantees all the technology components activated in the system to predictably meet timing constraints (given deadlines). In general, it is difficult, if not impossible, to tightly estimate the worst-case execution times (WCETs) of components. In addition, it is also difficult, if not impossible, to tightly estimate the end-to-end latency of components connected by a DAG. Autonomous driving systems based on the microautonomy architecture, therefore, must be designed to be fail-safe but not never-fail. We accept that the timing constraints may be violated (the given deadlines may be missed) as far as the overrun is taken into account. The overrun handlers are two-fold: (i) platform-defined and (ii) user-defined. The platform-defined handler is implemented as part of the platform by default, while the user-defined handler can overwrite it or add a new handler to the system. This is what we call \u201cfail-safe\u201d on a timely basis.
