Autoware is supported by people like you, and all types and sizes of contribution are welcome. As a contributor, here are the guidelines that we would like you to follow for Autoware and its associated repositories. Code of Conduct What should I know before I get started? Autoware concepts Contributing to open source projects How can I get help? How can I contribute? Participate in discussions Join a working group Report bugs Make a pull request Like Autoware itself, these guidelines are being actively developed and suggestions for improvement are always welcome! Guideline changes can be proposed by creating a discussion in the Ideas category . Code of Conduct # To ensure the Autoware community stays open and inclusive, please follow our code of conduct . If you believe that someone in the community has violated the code of conduct, please make a report by emailing conduct@autoware.org. What should I know before I get started? # Autoware concepts # To gain a high-level understanding of Autoware's architecture and design, the following pages provide a brief overview: Autoware architecture Autoware concepts For experienced developers, the Autoware interfaces and individual component pages should also be reviewed to understand the inputs and outputs for each component or module at a more detailed level. Contributing to open source projects # If you are new to open source projects, we recommend reading GitHub's How to Contribute to Open Source guide for an overview of why people contribute to open source projects, what it means to contribute and much more besides. How can I get help? # Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for confirmed bug reports. Instead, open a discussion in the Q&A category. For more details on the support mechanisms for Autoware, refer to the Support guidelines . Note Issues created for questions or unconfirmed bugs will be moved to GitHub discussions by the maintainers. How can I contribute? # Discussions # You can contribute to Autoware by facilitating and participating in discussions, such as: Proposing a new feature to enhance Autoware Joining an existing discussion and expressing your opinion Organizing discussions for other contributors Answering questions and supporting other contributors Working groups # The various working groups within the Autoware Foundation are responsible for accomplishing goals set by the Technical Steering Committee. These working groups are open to everyone, and joining a particular working group will allow you to gain an understanding of current projects, see how those projects are managed within each group and to contribute to issues that will help progress a particular project. To see the schedule for upcoming working group meetings, refer to the Autoware Foundation events calendar . Bug reports # Before you report a bug, please search the issue tracker for the appropriate repository. It is possible that someone has already reported the same issue and that workarounds exist. If you can't determine the appropriate repository, ask the maintainers for help by creating a new discussion in the Q&A category . When reporting a bug, you should provide a minimal set of instructions to reproduce the issue. Doing so allows us to quickly confirm and focus on the right problem. If you want to fix the bug by yourself that will be appreciated, but you should discuss possible approaches with the maintainers in the issue before submitting a pull request. Creating an issue is straightforward , but if you happen to experience any problems then create a Q&A discussion to ask for help. Pull requests # You can submit pull requests for small changes such as: Minor documentation updates Fixing spelling mistakes Fixing CI failures Fixing warnings detected by compilers or analysis tools Making small changes to a single package If your pull request is a large change, discuss with the maintainers before submission. Doing so ensures that the proposed change is in line with Autoware's design philosophy and current development plans. If you're not sure where to have that conversation, then create a new Q&A discussion . Examples of large changes include: Adding a new feature to Autoware Adding a new documentation page or section For more information on how to submit a good pull request, have a read of our pull request guidelines and don't forget to review the required license notations !","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Thank you for your interest in contributing!

Refer to GitHub Docs for the detailed explanation of the model. The following is a general example of our pull request workflow. Create a fork. (for the first time only) Create an issue. Discuss the approach to the issue with maintainers. Write code in the agreed approach. Write the tests and documentation if necessary. Follow our guidelines when you write code, tests, and documentation. Coding guidelines Testing guidelines Documentation guidelines Follow our Commit guidelines when commit your change. Test the code. In the later review process, you will need to write what tests you have done. Create a pull request. Read the pull request template carefully and fill the required content. Assign reviewers after creating a pull request. If you have no rights to assign reviewers, just mention them instead. If you are not sure who to set reviewers, contact to the people written as the maintainer tag in package.xml . Wait for the pull request to be reviewed. The reviewers will review your code following our review guidelines . Take a look at the guidelines as well because it is good to understand the thoughts of the reviewer's side. If CI checks have failed, fix the errors. Address the review comments pointed out by the reviewers. If you cannot understand or agree with a review comment, discuss it with the reviewers and find a rational reason. The author should be responsible for the final content of their pull request. The reviewers are obligated to make the author understand the meanings of each comment. After you have done with them, re-request a review to the reviewers and back to 6. If there are no more new review comments, the reviewers will approve the pull request and go to 6. Merge the pull request. Confirm all items of the checklist are checked off before merging. Anyone with write access can merge the pull request if there is no special request from maintainers. Generally, the author is expected to merge it to feel responsible for their pull request. If the author does not have write access, ask the reviewers or maintainers. It is the author's responsibility to care about their own pull request until it is merged. CI checks # Autoware has several checks for a pull request. The results are shown at the bottom of the pull request page as below. If the \u274c mark is shown, click the Details button and investigate the failure reason. If the Required mark is shown, you cannot merge the pull request unless you resolve the error. If not, it is optional, but preferably it should be fixed. The following sections explain about common CI checks in Autoware. Note that some repositories may have different settings. DCO # The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. This workflow checks whether the pull request fulfills DCO . You need to confirm the required items and commit with git commit -s . Refer to the GitHub App page for more information. semantic-pull-request # Autoware uses Conventional Commits with the settings of commitizen/conventional-commit-types . This workflow checks whether the pull request follows Conventional Commits . Note that if there is only one commit in the pull request, you need to make the commit title semantic as well. This is due to GitHub's non-intuitive behavior when there is only one commit. GitHub uses the commit title for the squashed commit message, instead of the pull request title. Refer to amannn/action-semantic-pull-request for more detailed behaviors of this workflow. See our commit guidelines for the detailed rules. pre-commit # pre-commit is a tool to run formatters or linters when you commit. This workflow checks whether the pull request has no error with pre-commit . In the workflow pre-commit.ci - pr is enabled in the repository, it will automatically fix errors by pre-commit.ci as many as possible. If there are some errors remain, fix them manually. You can run pre-commit in your local environment by the following command: pre-commit run -a Or you can install pre-commit to the repository and automatically run it before committing: pre-commit install Since it is difficult to detect errors with no false positives, some jobs are split into another config file and marked as optional. To check them, use the --config option: pre-commit run -a --config .pre-commit-config-optional.yaml spell-check-differential # This workflow detects spelling mistakes using CSpell with our dictionary file . You can submit pull requests to tier4/autoware-spell-check-dict to update the dictionary. Since it is difficult to detect errors with no false positives, it is an optional workflow, but it is preferable to remove spelling mistakes as many as possible. build-and-test-differential # This workflow checks colcon build and colcon test for the pull request. To make the CI faster, it doesn't check all packages but only modified packages and the dependencies. build-and-test-differential-self-hosted # This workflow is the ARM64 version of build-and-test-differential . You need to add the ARM64 label to run this workflow. For reference information, since ARM machines are not supported by GitHub-hosted runners, we use self-hosted runners prepared by the AWF. Refer to GitHub Docs for the details about self-hosted runners. deploy-docs # This workflow deploys the preview documentation site for the pull request.

Autoware provides value for both The technology developers of autonomous driving systems can create new components based on Autoware. The service operators of autonomous driving systems, on the other hand, can select appropriate technology components with Autoware. This is enabled by the microautonomy architecture that modularizes its software stack into the core and universe subsystems (modules). Microautonomy architecture # Autoware uses a pipeline architecture to enable the development of autonomous driving systems. The pipeline architecture used in Autoware consists of components similar to three-layer-architecture . And they run in parallel. There are 2 main modules: the Core and the Universe. The components in these modules are designed to be extensible and reusable. And we call it microautonomy architecture. The Core module # The Core module contains basic runtimes and technology components that satisfy the basic functionality and capability of sensing, computing, and actuation required for autonomous driving systems. AWF develops and maintains the Core module with their architects and leading members through their working groups. Anyone can contribute to the Core but the PR(Pull Request) acceptance criteria is more strict compared to the Universe. The Universe module # The Universe modules are extensions to the Core module that can be provided by the technology developers to enhance the functionality and capability of sensing, computing, and actuation. AWF provides the base Universe module to extend from. A key feature of the microautonomy architecture is that the Universe modules can be contributed to by any organization and individual. That is, you can even create your Universe and make it available for the Autoware community and ecosystem. AWF is responsible for quality control of the Universe modules through their development process. As a result, there are multiple types of the Universe modules - some are verified and validated by AWF and others are not. It is up to the users of Autoware which Universe modules are selected and integrated to build their end applications. Interface design # The interface design is the most essential piece of the microautonomy architecture, which is classified into internal and external interfaces. The component interface is designed for the components in a Universe module to communicate with those in other modules, including the Core module, within Autoware internally. The AD(Autonomous Driving) API, on the other hand, is designed for the applications of Autoware to access the technology components in the Core and Universe modules of Autoware externally. Designing solid interfaces, the microautonomy architecture is made possible with our partners, and at the same time is made feasible for our partners. Challenges # A grand challenge of the microautonomy architecture is to achieve real-time capability, which guarantees all the technology components activated in the system to predictably meet timing constraints (given deadlines). In general, it is difficult, if not impossible, to tightly estimate the worst-case execution times (WCETs) of components. In addition, it is also difficult, if not impossible, to tightly estimate the end-to-end latency of components connected by a DAG. Autonomous driving systems based on the microautonomy architecture, therefore, must be designed to be fail-safe but not never-fail. We accept that the timing constraints may be violated (the given deadlines may be missed) as far as the overrun is taken into account. The overrun handlers are two-fold: (i) platform-defined and (ii) user-defined. The platform-defined handler is implemented as part of the platform by default, while the user-defined handler can overwrite it or add a new handler to the system.

Since it was first released in 2015, there have been multiple releases made with differing underlying concepts, each one aimed at improving the software. Autoware.AI # Autoware.AI is the first distribution of Autoware that was released based on ROS 1. The repository contains a variety of packages covering different aspects of autonomous driving technologies - sensing, actuation, localization, mapping, perception and planning. While it was successful in attracting many developers and contributions, it was difficult to improve Autoware.AI's capabilities for a number of reasons: A lack of concrete architecture design leading to a lot of built-up technical debt, such as tight coupling between modules and unclear module responsibility. Differing coding standards for each package, with very low test coverage. Furthermore, there was no clear definition of the conditions under which an Autoware-enabled autonomous vehicle could operate, nor of the use cases or situations supported (eg: the ability to overtake a stationary vehicle). From the lessons learned from Autoware.AI development, a different development process was taken for Autoware.Auto to develop a ROS 2 version of Autoware. Warning Autoware.AI is currently in maintenance mode and will reach end-of-life at the end of 2022. Autoware.Auto # Autoware.Auto is the second distribution of Autoware that was released based on ROS 2. As part of the transition to ROS 2, it was decided to avoid simply porting Autoware.AI from ROS 1 to ROS 2. Instead, the codebase was rewritten from scratch with proper engineering practices, including defining target use cases and ODDs (eg: Autonomous Valet Parking [AVP], Cargo Delivery, etc.), designing a proper architecture, writing design documents and test code. Autoware.Auto development seemed to work fine initially, but after completing the AVP and and Cargo Delivery ODD projects, we started to see the following issues: The barrier to new engineers was too high. A lot of work was required to merge new features into Autoware.Auto, and so it was difficult for researchers and students to contribute to development. As a consequence, most Autoware.Auto developers were from companies in the Autoware Foundation and so there were very few people who were able to add state-of-the-art features from research papers. Making large-scale architecture changes was too difficult. To try out experimental architecture, there was a very large overhead involved in keeping the main branch stable whilst also making sure that every change satisfied the continuous integration requirements. Autoware Core/Universe # In order to address the issues with Autoware.Auto development, the Autoware Foundation decided to create a new architecture called Autoware Core/Universe. Autoware Core carries over the original policy of Autoware.Auto to be a stable and well-tested codebase. Alongside Autoware Core is a new concept called Autoware Universe, which acts as an extension of Autoware Core with the following benefits: Users can easily replace a Core component with a Universe equivalent in order to use more advanced features, such as a new Localization or Perception algorithm. Code quality requirements for Universe are more relaxed to make it easier for new developers, students and researchers to contribute, but will still be stricter than the requirements for Autoware.AI. Any advanced features added to Universe that are useful to the wider Autoware community will be reviewed and considered for potential inclusion in the main Autoware Core codebase. This way, the primary requirement of having a stable and safe autonomous driving system can be achieved, whilst simultaneously enabling access to state-of-the-art features created by third-party contributors.

The repository contains a variety of packages covering different aspects of autonomous driving technologies - sensing, actuation, localization, mapping, perception and planning. While it was successful in attracting many developers and contributions, it was difficult to improve Autoware.AI's capabilities for a number of reasons: A lack of concrete architecture design leading to a lot of built-up technical debt, such as tight coupling between modules and unclear module responsibility. Differing coding standards for each package, with very low test coverage. Furthermore, there was no clear definition of the conditions under which an Autoware-enabled autonomous vehicle could operate, nor of the use cases or situations supported (eg: the ability to overtake a stationary vehicle). From the lessons learned from Autoware.AI development, a different development process was taken for Autoware.Auto to develop a ROS 2 version of Autoware.

The first one is Autoware AD API for operating the vehicle from outside the autonomous driving system such as the Fleet Management System (FMS) and Human Machine Interface (HMI) for operators or passengers. The second one is Autoware component interface for components to communicate with each other. The last one is the local interface used inside the component. Concept # Applications can operate multiple and various vehicles in a common way. Applications are not affected by version updates and implementation changes. Developers only need to know the interface to add new features and hardware. Requirements # Goals: AD API provides functionality to create the following applications: Drive the vehicle on the route or drive to the requested positions in order. Operate vehicle behavior such as starting and stopping. Display or announce the vehicle status to operators, passengers, and people around. Control vehicle devices such as doors. Monitor the vehicle or drive it manually. AD API provides stable and long-term specifications. This enables unified access to all vehicles. AD API hides differences in version and implementation and absorbs the impact of changes. AD API has a default implementation and can be applied to some simple ODDs with options. The AD API implementation is extensible with the third-party components as long as it meets the specifications. The component interface provides stable and medium-term specifications. This makes it easier to add components. The component interface clarifies the public and private parts of a component and improves maintainability. The component interface is extensible with the third-party design to improve the sub-components' reusability. Non-goals: AD API does not cover security. Use it with other reliable methods. The component interface is just a specification, it does not include an implementation. Architecture # The components of Autoware are connected via the component interface. Each component uses the interface to provide functionality and to access other components. AD API implementation is also a component. Since the functional elements required for AD API are defined as the component interface, other components do not need to consider AD API directly. Tools for evaluation and debugging, such as simulators, access both AD API and the component interface. The component interface has a hierarchical specification. The top-level architecture consists of some components. Each component has some options of the next-level architecture. Developers select one of them when implementing the component. The simplest next-level architecture is monolithic. This is an all-in-one and black box implementation, and is suitable for small group development, prototyping, and very complex functions. Others are arbitrary architecture consists of sub-components and have advantages for large group development. A sub-component can be combined with others that adopt the same architecture. Third parties can define and publish their own architecture and interface for open source development. It is desirable to propose them for standardization if they are sufficiently evaluated. Features # Communication methods # As shown in the table below, interfaces are classified into four communication methods to define their behavior. Function Call is a request-response communication and is used for processing that requires immediate results. The others are publish-subscribe communication. Notification is used to process data that changes with some event, typically a callback. Streams handle continuously changing data. Reliable Stream expects all data to arrive without loss, Realtime Stream expects the latest data to arrive with low delay. Communication Method ROS Implementation Optional Implementation Function Call Service HTTP Notification Topic (reliable, transient_local) MQTT (QoS=2, retain) Reliable Stream Topic (reliable, volatile) MQTT (QoS=2) Realtime Stream Topic (best_effort, volatile) MQTT (QoS=0) These methods are provided as services or topics of ROS since Autoware is developed using ROS and mainly communicates with its packages. On the other hand, FMS and HMI are often implemented without ROS, Autoware is also expected to communicate with applications that do not use ROS. It is wasteful for each of these applications to have an adapter for Autoware, and a more suitable means of communication is required. HTTP and MQTT are suggested as additional options because these protocols are widely used and can substitute the behavior of services and topics. In that case, text formats such as JSON where field names are repeated in an array of objects, are inefficient and it is necessary to consider the serialization. Naming convention # The name of the interface must be /<component name>/api/<interface name> , where <component name> is the name of the component. For an AD API component, omit this part and start with /api . The <interface name> is an arbitrary string separated by slashes. Note that this rule causes a restriction that the namespace api must not be used as a name other than AD API and the component interface. The following are examples of correct interface names for AD API and the component interface: /api/autoware/state /api/autoware/engage /planning/api/route/set /vehicle/api/status The following are examples of incorrect interface names for AD API and the component interface: /ad_api/autoware/state /autoware/engage /planning/route/set/api /vehicle/my_api/status Logging # It is recommended to log the interface for analysis of vehicle behavior. If logging is needed, rosbag is available for topics, and use logger in rclcpp or rclpy for services. Typically, create a wrapper for service and client classes that logs when a service is called. Restrictions # For each API, consider the restrictions such as following and describe them if necessary. Services: response time pre-condition post-condition execution order concurrent execution Topics: recommended delay range maximum delay recommended frequency range minimum frequency default frequency Data structure # Data type definition # Do not share the types in AD API unless they are obviously the same to avoid changes in one API affecting another. Also, implementation-dependent types, including the component interface, should not be used in AD API for the same reason. Use the type in AD API in implementation, or create the same type and copy the data to convert the type. Constants and enumeration # Since ROS don't support enumeration, use constants instead. The default value of type such as zero and empty string should not be used to detect that a variable is unassigned. Alternatively, assign it a dedicated name to indicate that it is undefined. If one type has multiple enumerations, comment on the correspondence between constants and variables. Assign unique values to all constants so that it can be distinguished from other enumerations. Do not use enumeration values directly, as assignments are subject to change when the version is updated. Time stamp # Clarify what the timestamp indicates. for example, send time, measurement time, update time, etc. Consider having multiple timestamps if necessary. Use std_msgs/msg/Header when using ROS transform. Also consider whether the header is common to all data, independent for each data, or additional timestamp is required. Request header # Currently, there is no required header. Response status # The interfaces whose communication method is Function Call use a common response status to unify the error format. These interfaces should include a variable of ResponseStatus with the name status in the response. See autoware_ad_api_msgs/msg/ResponseStatus for details. Concerns, assumptions and limitations # The applications use the version information provided by AD API to check compatibility. Unknown versions are also treated as available as long as the major versions match (excluding major version 0). Compatibility between AD API and the component interface is assumed to be maintained by the version management system. If an unintended behavior of AD API is detected, the application should take appropriate action. Autoware tries to keep working as long as possible, but it is not guaranteed to be safe. Safety should be considered for the entire system, including the applications.","title":"Autoware interface design"},{"location":"design/autoware-interfaces/#autoware-interface-design","text":"","title":"Autoware interface design"},{"location":"design/autoware-interfaces/#abstract","text":"Autoware defines three categories of interfaces.

Since Autoware may not be able to guarantee safety, such as switching to autonomous mode during overspeed, it changes to transition mode before autonomous mode. During the transition mode, the previous operator should ensure safety. If Autoware succeeds in taking over, the mode changes to autonomous. The manual mode is direct, none, local or remote. Autoware does not guarantee safety in these modes unless it is stopped by none mode. Direct mode is supported on some vehicles that have an interface to operate directly, such as steering and pedals, etc. None mode is used to stop the vehicle when the operator is temporarily absent due to a change of operator. In local and remote modes, Autoware controls the vehicle based on commands from the operator. State Description DIRECT The vehicle is operated directly without Autoware. This mode is only available on some vehicles. NONE The vehicle is not operated by anyone. Autoware controls the vehicle to hold a stop. LOCAL The vehicle is operated by the local operator. Autoware controls the vehicle based on commands from the operator. REMOTE The vehicle is operated by the remote operator. Autoware controls the vehicle based on commands from the operator. AUTONOMOUS The vehicle is operated autonomously. Autoware controls the vehicle. TRANSITION The vehicle is operated autonomously.

If you need more detailed information, refer to the colcon documentation . Common mistakes # Do not run from other than the workspace root # It is important that you always run colcon build from the workspace root because colcon builds only under the current directory. If you have mistakenly built in a wrong directory, run rm -rf build/ install/ log/ to clean the generated files. Do not unnecessarily overlay workspaces # colcon overlays workspaces if you have sourced the setup.bash of other workspaces before building a workspace. You should take care of this especially when you have multiple workspaces. Run echo $COLCON_PREFIX_PATH to check whether workspaces are overlaid. If you find some workspaces are unnecessarily overlaid, remove all built files, restart the terminal to clean environment variables, and re-build the workspace. For more details about workspace overlaying , refer to the ROS 2 documentation . Cleaning up the build artifacts # colcon sometimes causes errors of because of the old cache. To remove the cache and rebuild the workspace, run the following command: rm -rf build/ install/ In case you know what packages to remove: rm -rf { build,install } / { package_a,package_b } Selecting packages to build # To just build specified packages: colcon build --packages-select <package_name1> <package_name2> ...

Introduction # Currently, Autoware assumes that vehicles use an Ackermann kinematic model with Ackermann steering. Thus, Autoware adopts the Ackermann command format for the Control module's output (see the AckermannDrive ROS message definition for an overview of Ackermann commands, and the AckermannControlCommands struct used in Autoware for more details). However, it is possible to integrate Autoware with a vehicle that follows a differential drive kinematic model, as commonly used by small mobile robots. 2. Procedure # One simple way of using Autoware with a differential drive vehicle is to create a vehicle_interface package that translates Ackermann commands to differential drive commands. Here are two points that you need to consider: Create vehicle_interface package for differential drive vehicle Set an appropriate wheel_base 2.1 Create a vehicle_interface package for differential drive vehicle # An Ackermann command in Autoware consists of two main control inputs: steering angle ( \\omega \\omega ) velocity ( v v ) Conversely, a typical differential drive command consists of the following inputs: left wheel velocity ( v_l v_l ) right wheel velocity ( v_r v_r ) So, one way in which an Ackermann command can be converted to a differential drive command is by using the following equations: v_l = v - \\frac{l\\omega}{2}, v_r = v + \\frac{l\\omega}{2} v_l = v - \\frac{l\\omega}{2}, v_r = v + \\frac{l\\omega}{2} where l l denotes wheel tread. For information about other factors that need to be considered when creating a vehicle_interface package, refer to the vehicle_interface component page . 2.2 Set an appropriate wheel_base # A differential drive robot does not necessarily have front and rear wheels, which means that the wheelbase (the horizontal distance between the axles of the front and rear wheels) cannot be defined. However, Autoware expects wheel_base to be set in vehicle_info.param.yaml with some value. Thus, you need to set a pseudo value for wheel_base . The appropriate pseudo value for wheel_base depends on the size of your vehicle. Setting it to be the same value as wheel_tread is one possible choice. Warning If the wheel_base value is set too small then the vehicle may behave unexpectedly. For example, the vehicle may drive beyond the bounds of a calculated path. Conversely, if wheel_base is set too large, the vehicle's range of motion will be restricted. The reason being that Autoware's Planning module will calculate an overly conservative trajectory based on the assumed vehicle length. 3. Known issues # Motion model incompatibility # Since Autoware assumes that vehicles use a steering system, it is not possible to take advantage of the flexibility of a differential drive system's motion model. For example, when planning a parking maneuver with the freespace_planner module, Autoware may drive the differential drive vehicle forward and backward, even if the vehicle can be parked with a simpler trajectory that uses pure rotational movement.","title":"How to integrate Autoware with a differential drive vehicle"},{"location":"how-to-guides/how-to-integrate-autoware-with-a-diff-drive-vehicle/#how-to-integrate-autoware-with-a-differential-drive-vehicle","text":"","title":"How to integrate Autoware with a differential drive vehicle"},{"location":"how-to-guides/how-to-integrate-autoware-with-a-diff-drive-vehicle/#1-introduction","text":"Currently, Autoware assumes that vehicles use an Ackermann kinematic model with Ackermann steering.

To resolve these types of problems, first try cleaning your build artifacts and rebuilding: rm -rf build/ install/ log/ colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release If the error is not resolved, remove src/ and update your workspace according to installation type ( Docker / source ). Warning Before removing src/ , confirm that there are no modifications in your local environment that you want to keep! If errors still persist after trying the steps above, delete the entire workspace, clone the repository once again and restart the installation process. rm -rf autoware/ git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.git Errors when using a fixed version of Autoware # In principle, errors should not occur when using a fixed version. That said, possible causes include: ROS 2 has been updated with breaking changes. For confirmation, check the Packaging and Release Management tag on ROS Discourse. Your local environment is broken. Confirm your .bashrc file, environment variables, and library versions. In addition to the causes listed above, there are two common misunderstandings around the use of fixed versions.

You can confirm if this is the case by searching for Could not find lanelet map under {path-to-map-dir}/lanelet2_map.osm errors in the log. Another possible reason is that map loading is taking a long time due to poor DDS performance.
