General pull request workflow # Autoware uses the fork-and-pull model. Refer to GitHub Docs for the detailed explanation of the model. The following is a general example of our pull request workflow. Create a fork. (for the first time only) Create an issue. Discuss the approach to the issue with maintainers. Write code in the agreed approach. Write the tests and documentation if necessary. Follow our guidelines when you write code, tests, and documentation. Coding guidelines Testing guidelines Documentation guidelines Follow our Commit guidelines when commit your change. Test the code. In the later review process, you will need to write what tests you have done. Create a pull request. Read the pull request template carefully and fill the required content. Assign reviewers after creating a pull request. If you have no rights to assign reviewers, just mention them instead. If you are not sure who to set reviewers, contact to the people written as the maintainer tag in package.xml . Wait for the pull request to be reviewed. The reviewers will review your code following our review guidelines . Take a look at the guidelines as well because it is good to understand the thoughts of the reviewer's side. If CI checks have failed, fix the errors. Address the review comments pointed out by the reviewers. If you cannot understand or agree with a review comment, discuss it with the reviewers and find a rational reason. The author should be responsible for the final content of their pull request. The reviewers are obligated to make the author understand the meanings of each comment. After you have done with them, re-request a review to the reviewers and back to 6. If there are no more new review comments, the reviewers will approve the pull request and go to 6. Merge the pull request. Confirm all items of the checklist are checked off before merging. Anyone with write access can merge the pull request if there is no special request from maintainers. Generally, the author is expected to merge it to feel responsible for their pull request. If the author does not have write access, ask the reviewers or maintainers. It is the author's responsibility to care about their own pull request until it is merged. CI checks # Autoware has several checks for a pull request. The results are shown at the bottom of the pull request page as below. If the \u274c mark is shown, click the Details button and investigate the failure reason. If the Required mark is shown, you cannot merge the pull request unless you resolve the error. If not, it is optional, but preferably it should be fixed. The following sections explain about common CI checks in Autoware. Note that some repositories may have different settings. DCO # The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. This workflow checks whether the pull request fulfills DCO . You need to confirm the required items and commit with git commit -s . Refer to the GitHub App page for more information. semantic-pull-request # Autoware uses Conventional Commits with the settings of commitizen/conventional-commit-types . This workflow checks whether the pull request follows Conventional Commits . Note that if there is only one commit in the pull request, you need to make the commit title semantic as well. This is due to GitHub's non-intuitive behavior when there is only one commit. GitHub uses the commit title for the squashed commit message, instead of the pull request title. Refer to amannn/action-semantic-pull-request for more detailed behaviors of this workflow. See our commit guidelines for the detailed rules. pre-commit # pre-commit is a tool to run formatters or linters when you commit. This workflow checks whether the pull request has no error with pre-commit . In the workflow pre-commit.ci - pr is enabled in the repository, it will automatically fix errors by pre-commit.ci as many as possible. If there are some errors remain, fix them manually. You can run pre-commit in your local environment by the following command: pre-commit run -a Or you can install pre-commit to the repository and automatically run it before committing: pre-commit install Since it is difficult to detect errors with no false positives, some jobs are split into another config file and marked as optional. To check them, use the --config option: pre-commit run -a --config .pre-commit-config-optional.yaml spell-check-differential # This workflow detects spelling mistakes using CSpell with our dictionary file . You can submit pull requests to tier4/autoware-spell-check-dict to update the dictionary. Since it is difficult to detect errors with no false positives, it is an optional workflow, but it is preferable to remove spelling mistakes as many as possible. build-and-test-differential # This workflow checks colcon build and colcon test for the pull request. To make the CI faster, it doesn't check all packages but only modified packages and the dependencies. build-and-test-differential-self-hosted # This workflow is the ARM64 version of build-and-test-differential . You need to add the ARM64 label to run this workflow. For reference information, since ARM machines are not supported by GitHub-hosted runners, we use self-hosted runners prepared by the AWF. Refer to GitHub Docs for the details about self-hosted runners. deploy-docs # This workflow deploys the preview documentation site for the pull request.

The first one is Autoware AD API for operating the vehicle from outside the autonomous driving system such as the Fleet Management System (FMS) and Human Machine Interface (HMI) for operators or passengers. The second one is Autoware Component Interface for internal components to communicate with each other. Concept # Applications can operate multiple and various vehicles in a common way. Applications are not affected by version updates and implementation changes. Developers only need to know the interface to add new features and hardware. Requirements # Goals: AD API provides functionality to create the following applications: Drive the vehicle on the route or drive to the requested positions in order. Operate vehicle behavior such as starting and stopping. Display or announce the vehicle status to operators, passengers, and people around. Control vehicle devices such as doors. Monitor the vehicle or drive it manually. AD API provides stable and long-term specifications. This enables unified access to all vehicles. AD API hides differences in version and implementation and absorbs the impact of changes. AD API has a default implementation and can be applied to some simple ODDs with options. The AD API implementation is extensible with the third-party components as long as it meets the specifications. Component Interface provides stable and medium-term specifications. This makes it easier to add components. Component Interface clarifies the public and private parts of a component and improves maintainability. Component Interface is extensible with the third-party design to improve the sub-components' reusability. Non-goals: AD API does not cover security. Use it with other reliable methods. Component Interface is just a specification, it does not include an implementation. Architecture # The components of Autoware are connected via Component Interface. Each component uses the interface to provide functionality and to access other components. AD API implementation is also a component. Since the functional elements required for AD API are defined as Component Interface, other components do not need to consider AD API directly. Tools for evaluation and debugging, such as simulators, access both AD API and Component Interface. Component Interface has a hierarchical specification. The top-level architecture consists of some components. Each component has some options of the next-level architecture. Developers select one of them when implementing the component. The simplest next-level architecture is monolithic. This is an all-in-one and black box implementation, and is suitable for small group development, prototyping, and very complex functions. Others are arbitrary architecture consists of sub-components and have advantages for large group development. A sub-component can be combined with others that adopt the same architecture. Third parties can define and publish their own architecture and interface for open source development. It is desirable to propose them for standardization if they are sufficiently evaluated. Features # Communication Method # As shown in the table below, interfaces are classified into four communication methods to define their behavior. Function Call is a request-response communication and is used for processing that requires immediate results. The others are publish-subscribe communication. Notification is used to process data that changes with some event, typically a callback. Streams handle continuously changing data. Reliable Stream expects all data to arrive without loss, Realtime Stream expects the latest data to arrive with low delay. Communication Method ROS Implementation Optional Implementation Function Call Service HTTP Notification Topic (reliable, transient_local) MQTT (QoS=2, retain) Reliable Stream Topic (reliable, volatile) MQTT (QoS=2) Realtime Stream Topic (best_effort, volatile) MQTT (QoS=0) These methods are provided as services or topics of ROS since Autoware is developed using ROS and mainly communicates with its packages. On the other hand, FMS and HMI are often implemented without ROS, Autoware is also expected to communicate with applications that do not use ROS. It is wasteful for each of these applications to have an adapter for Autoware, and a more suitable means of communication is required. HTTP and MQTT are suggested as additional options because these protocols are widely used and can substitute the behavior of services and topics. In that case, text formats such as JSON where field names are repeated in an array of objects, are inefficient and it is necessary to consider the serialization. Naming Convention # The name of the interface must be /<component name>/api/<version>/<interface name> , where <component name> is the name of the component. For an AD API component, omit this part and start with /api . The <version> is a major version with v such as v1 . This can provide older interfaces for backward compatibility. The <interface name> is an arbitrary string separated by slashes. Note that this rule causes a restriction that the namespace api must not be used as a name other than AD API and Component Interface. The following are examples of correct interface names for AD API and Component Interface: /api/v1/autoware/state /api/v1/autoware/engage /planning/api/v1/route/change /vehicle/api/v1/status The following are examples of incorrect interface names for AD API and Component Interface: /api/autoware/state /autoware/state /planning/route/api/v1 /vehicle/my_api/v1/status Logging # It is recommended to log the interface for analysis of vehicle behavior. If logging is needed, rosbag is available for topics, and use logger in rclcpp or rclpy for services. Typically, create a wrapper for services and clients that logs when a method is called. Restrictions # For each API, consider the restrictions such as following and describe them if necessary. Services: response time pre-condition post-condition execution order concurrent execution Topics: recommended delay range maximum delay recommended frequency range minimum frequency default frequency Data Structure # Data Type Definition # Do not share the types in AD API unless they are obviously the same to avoid changes in one API affecting another. Also, implementation-dependent types, including Component Interface, should not be used in AD API for the same reason. Use the type in AD API in implementation, or create the same type and copy the data to convert the type. Constants and Enumeration # Since ROS don't support enumeration, use constants instead. The default value of type such as zero and empty string should not be used to detect that a variable is unassigned. Alternatively, assign it a dedicated name to indicate that it is undefined. If one type has multiple enumerations, comment on the correspondence between constants and variables. Assign unique values to all constants so that it can be distinguished from other enumerations. Do not use enumeration values directly, as assignments are subject to change when the version is updated. Time Stamp # Clarify what the timestamp indicates. for example, send time, measurement time, update time, etc. Consider having multiple timestamps if necessary. Use std_msgs/msg/Header when using ROS transform. Also consider whether the header is common to all data, independent for each data, or additional timestamp is required. Request Header # Currently, there is no required header. Response Status # The interfaces whose communication method is Function Call use a common response status to unify the error format. For those interfaces, include the ResponseStatus shown below in the response with the name status. The data status.summary.code is the execution result of the interface, and the caller branches the process according to this value. Others are for the users and should not be used directly by the program. These data are primarily used to provide users with solution tips and to ask the developer for the cause of the error. The typical use of the field details is when an interface calls other interfaces. That interface stores response statuses in details , then merges them and sets the result to summary . This allows the user to know which component was causing the error by checking details .

The typical use of the field details is when an interface calls other interfaces. That interface stores response statuses in details , then merges them and sets the result to summary . This allows the user to know which component was causing the error by checking details .

Warning The namings of each simulation are under discussion and would be changed in the near future. Simulation methods # Ad hoc simulation # Ad hoc simulation is a simulation method that you run simulations flexibly on your local machine. It is recommended for your first trial. Scenario simulation # Scenario simulation is a simulation method that a scenario runner runs simulations based on scenarios you defined. It is often run automatically on a CI system, but you can also run this simulation on your local machine. Simulation types # Autoware supports three types of simulations. Note that it is just a rough classification, and that there are several minor derivative versions. Planning simulation # Planning simulation is a simulation type that uses simple dummy data and tests mainly planning/control components. Rosbag replay simulation # Rosbag replay simulation is a simulation type that uses Rosbag data and tests mainly perception modules. Sometimes it is used for endurance tests by repeatedly playing back the data.
